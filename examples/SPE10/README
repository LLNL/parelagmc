Some info on SPE10 dataset:

Model dimensions are 1200 x 2200 x 170 (ft.).
The fine scale cell size is 20 x 10 x 2 ft.
The fine scale model size is 60 x 220 x 85 cells.

However, I find it useful to start with a coarser version of the 
model, i.e. specify N (number of elements in each direction),
h (element sizes (int for now)), and n (the number of elements added
on each side in the mesh embedding).

Should load the entirety of the SPE10 data set (regardless of N, h)
so have removed SetNumberCells and SetMeshSizes option so is set
by default to 60,220,85 and 20,10,2.

Currently, the structured mesh is generated by MFEM. 
The six boundary attributes are numbered as bottom, front, right,
back, left, top.
